    <h2>What do we do<span class="color">?</span></h2>
    <p>
      For our course 2IOA0 (DBL HTI and Webtech) we are building a website that can visualize a dataset. These
      visualizations are build using Javascript, HTML and CSS. On this website, a dataset can be uploaded as a .csv file
      and then the data is shown in an adjacency matrix or a hierarchical edge bundling. When the data is uploaded, the user
      can choose on what kind of attributes the visualization has to be build.
      A user can also add other relevant attributes, which are otherwise unused. This will not change the appearance of the
      visualization, but it will add the attribute to the information box for further inspection later on.
    </p>

  <div class="infobox">
    <h2>About the visualization<span class="color">.</span></h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, our two visualizations are the adjacency matrix and the hierarchicaledge bundling diagram.
      These visualizations are chosen because they both work great for big datasets, like the "enron-v1.csv" file, which was
      used to make the visualization. In the adjacency matrix, a large matrix is shown, whenever two attributes match,
      the matrix will be colored. The density of the relationship is represented by a darker shade while different types
      of relationships can be represented by different colours. In the hierarchical edge diagram, we see what people had interactions
      with each other. Also in this one, the density is represented by a difference in color and opacity. </p>

      More information on the visualizations can be found on the Background Info tab.
